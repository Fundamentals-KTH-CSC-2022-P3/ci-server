# Continuous Integration Server

Welcome to our implementation of a minimalistic CI-Server.

## Setup

This project uses the following tools:

- Java 17
- Maven
- IntelliJ Ultimate

### About the java version

We'd recommend using the OpenJDK version of Java 17, though it should still work independently of JVM implementation.

### IntelliJ IDEA for students

This project is created and coded with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate. You can follow the link here for the [license for the IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students), and then install it through any package manager of your choice. Use your license to verify your copy.

The community edition of IntelliJ IDEA should work as well, but it isn't tested.

### Maven

Install maven through a package manager. Open the project in IntelliJ and go to:

1. Click File -> Settings.
2. Expand Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven.
3. Check Use plugin registry.
4. Click OK or Apply.

Restart IntelliJ for the changes to take effect. 

After restart, open the right Maven pane and click the Reload All Maven Projects button, and then run the _clean_ and 
_install_ Lifecycles.  

## Run/Debug Config

Set up a run and debug config by:

1. Click Configurations -> Edit Configurations.
2. Add a configuration to the list of type Application
3. Choose Java 17 as SDK and choose main class as _fundamentals.server.ContinuousIntegrationServer_
4. Click OK or Apply

## Test execution on the CI server
The CI server runs the tests of the tested repo by running `mvn test` in the root of the tested repo.
This generates a Surefire test report, which is what the CI server looks through to find any failed tests.

This functionality is unit tested by creating dummy reports in a directory that is empty save for the
correct Surefire report folder structure, and checking the result of looking through these dummy reports.
